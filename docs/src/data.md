# ðŸ“… Weather Data

Several (and more coming) weather station format can be read and transformed to `DataFrame`.

## ECA dataset

From the [European Climate Assessment & Dataset project](https://www.ecad.eu/) at this [link for zip](https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/predefinedseries.php) of all stations per variables and at this [link for custom](https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/customquery.php) **manual** query.
I asked them about an API to extract directly a specific file automatically, but they answer it is not currently available.
I tried [unzip-http](https://github.com/saulpw/unzip-http) but could not get it working with ECA website[^1]

[^1]: I don't remember exactly in fact.

## [MÃ©tÃ©o France](@id DataMeteofrance)

MÃ©tÃ©o France do have a version of this data and it is accessible through an API on the website [Data.Gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/).
This package provides a simple command to extract the data of one station (given its STAtionID) from the API.

````@example data
collect_data_MeteoFrance(49215002)[1:10,:]

## INRAE

The INRAE CLIMATIK platform [delannoy2022climatik](@cite) ([https://agroclim.inrae.fr/climatik/](https://agroclim.inrae.fr/climatik/), in French) managed by the AgroClim laboratory of Avignon, France has weather stations. However, their API is not open access.
